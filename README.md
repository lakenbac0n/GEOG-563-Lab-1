Coding Challenge: develop R code to simulate a Lotka-volterra predator prey-system. Use Euler integration, which is basically a for-loop, to simulate changes in the predator and prey populations over time. 

The Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model describes how two populations (a prey species and a predator species) interact over time.

Predatory-prey dynamics for model populations:
